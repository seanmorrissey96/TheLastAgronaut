# The Last Agronaut

The Last Agronaut is a third person sci-fi RPG, in which the player takes the role of Penelope, the titular Agronaut. She comes from an extremely science-oriented planet, where when you reach a certain level in your field, you are assigned a plot of land, which is then sent into space for you to spend the rest of your life researching. Penelope is one of these scientists, doing research on viruses, with her trusty AI companion GPS. You fill her shoes, dealing with the consequences of a crashed asteroid on your island. 


The Last Agronaut was developed by Team Nova, as part of the Fourth Year Team Project in the Computing in Games Development course at DkIT.
